WooCommerce Full-Width Add-to-Cart Forms
======================

If the add-to-cart form of your products appears very narrow or squeezed, you can use this plugin to move the add-to-cart form under the product image and summary section. The plugin allows you to select specific product types that will use this modified, full-width layout.
