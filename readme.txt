A handy plugin for optimizing the add-to-cart form layout of complex WooCommerce product types, which may appear very narrow or squeezed.

== Description ==

By default, WooCommerce places single-product summaries right next to the main product image / thumbnails section, which is ideal for displaying product descriptions, prices and meta. Add-to-cart forms are normally displayed inside the single-product summary, too, which works well when displaying Simple or Variable product forms. 

However, this layout is not particularly suitable for complex product types, such as Composites or Bundles, which require much more space for their add-to-cart form content.

If you are having issues with very narrow or squeezed product add-to-cart forms, you can use this plugin to move the add-to-cart form under the product image and summary section. 

The plugin adds an "Add-to-Cart Form Layout" section under "WooCommerce→Settings→Products", where you can select which product types should use the modified, full-width layout.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
